## Tasks Yet To Be Done... (just type your name inside [] to indicate you're working on it)

> Note that all work should be under core/ directory which should be organized per command.


### Core Functionalities
- [ ] Implement the `!schedule` command to schedule meetings/tasks.
  - Parse meeting title/description, date, time, and optional participants from user input.
  - Validate and store the meeting details in a structured format.
- [ ] Implement the `!reminders` command to list all upcoming reminders for the user.
- [ ] Implement the `!delete <ID>` command to cancel a specific reminder.
- [ ] Add a `!help` command to display all available commands and usage examples.


### Reminder Mechanism
- [ ] Create a background task or scheduler to check for upcoming reminders.
  - Send reminders 10 minutes before events by default.
  - Support customizable lead times (e.g., 30 minutes).
- [ ] Enable reminders via Direct Messages (DMs) or in specific channels.


### Time Management
- [ ] Add support for both absolute (`2024-12-30 15:00`) and relative times (`in 2 hours`).
- [ ] Implement timezone support:
  - Allow users to set their preferred timezone.
  - Handle automatic timezone conversions.


### Data Handling
- [ ] Store reminders persistently in `data/reminders.json`.
- [ ] Add error handling for invalid inputs or missing fields in commands.


### Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Test all implemented commands thoroughly.
- [ ] Add documentation for:
  - Setting up and running the bot.
  - Using each command with examples.
  - Troubleshooting common issues.
